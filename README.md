# Contemporary Issues In Data
In this document, I discuss two articles about AI and artists.

## Article 1: Forbes
[The Creative Renaissance: How AI is Elevating Human Imagination and Potential](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2024/01/08/the-creative-renaissance-how-ai-is-elevating-human-imagination-and-potential/?sh=22f00eb34397)

OpenAI's DALL-E appears to be one of the most powerful, if not the most powerful, generative artificial intelligence (AI) forces globally. From my understanding, AI possesses the capability to perform many tasks that humans can, such as problem-solving, decision-making, and critical thinking. Previously, the only aspect seemingly beyond AI's reach was human creativity; however, that has now changed.

Generative AI has unlocked something intrinsically human within computers, potentially reshaping society's perception and demand for creative fields and work. As AI advances, I immediately sense a pressing need for regulations that protect artists and graphic designers from the potential of AI replacing their jobs. Overall, I believe that regulation is essential as AI continues to progress. However, I also anticipate challenges in its implementation, possibly driven by a desire to solidify the United States as the leading figure in this field.


## Article 2: TechCrunch
[Nightshade, the tool that 'poisons' data, giving artists a fighting chance against AI](https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/26/nightshade-the-tool-that-poisons-data-gives-artists-a-fighting-chance-against-ai/)

It's incredibly refreshing to learn about Computer Science professionals creating tools to support artists in their ongoing battle against AI. Given the prevailing mistrust towards companies like OpenAI, Nightshade provides a powerful tool for artists to protect their work from potential exploitation. As explained by Ben Zhao, the professor leading this project, Nightshade disrupts image data, rendering it useless for AI model training. This showcases that while Computer Science fuels the rapid development of AI, it can also be harnessed to counteract unethical practices employed by AI companies.

Furthermore, the ability of this project to 'poison' image data and misguide AI models underscores the somewhat formulaic nature of AI. It suggests that, at least for now, AI struggles to navigate around these deliberately obscured images. However, as AI continues to evolve, this may change, and Nightshade's effectiveness could diminish. Considering the multitude of AI companies in operation today and their continued growth, the potential misuse of other people's work remains a concern. Questions linger about whether these artists will ever receive proper compensation for the use of their creations.
